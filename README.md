# Social Network API

## Description

API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

- This project allowed me to play around with alternatives to SQL databases (Mongodb specifically)
- This experience was much less rigid than the databases we've built previously
- During this projected, I was better able to conceptualize how subdocuments work.

## Installation

Clone the repo and navigate to the directory in your terminal to open it in VSCode.
Open the package.json in the integrated terminal and run the appropriate command to install the dependencies.
'node server.js' to start the server.

## Usage

Use a tool like insomnia to test the routes.
